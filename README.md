# Visualize-Gender-Equality---Violence-against-Women-and-Girls
The UN describes violence against women and girls (VAWG) as: â€œone of the most widespread, persistent, and devastating human rights violations in our world today. It remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma, and shame surrounding it.   Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.   While gender-based violence can happen to anyone, anywhere, some women and girls are particularly vulnerable. 

What can we do to help them?
